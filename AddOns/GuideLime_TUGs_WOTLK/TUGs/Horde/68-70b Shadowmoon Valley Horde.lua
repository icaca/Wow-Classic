I am leaving out EVERY Elite quest and most dungeons in this guide. especially on release YOU SHOULD NOT!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons. Do them as often as you can and at least once for their quests!

currently this guide stops here-> Finish Shadowmoon Valley or go to Netherstorm(make sure youre aldor or seer before) and finish the last couple of bars.
It was either finishing tbc stuff or making sure WOTLK guides were as good as possible. Have a nice day! :)
