# AutoLoggerClassic
A World of Warcraft: Classic addon for automatically triggering combat logging on and off in raids and/or dungeons.

`/alc` and `/autologgerclassic` will open the config.

`/alc minimap` and `/autologgerclassic minimap` will toggle the minimap button on or off.

Configure in which dungeons and/or raids to automatically combat log in the options. Enter said dungeon or raid and you will automatically be combat logging (and be notified of it)! Make sure to enable advanced combat logging in System > Network.
