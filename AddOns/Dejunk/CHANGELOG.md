# Dejunk Changelog

## 9.0.15

- Removed the "Destroy All Items" keybind in favor of "Start Destroying"
- Removed the `/dejunk destroy all` command in favor of `/dejunk destroy start`
- Added "Sell > Auto Open" option, which automatically opens/closes the Sell frame upon opening a merchant window
- Updated the functionality of the Sell/Destroy frame buttons to "Start Selling/Destroying" instead of "Sell/Destroy Next Item" (items can still be sold/destroyed one at a time by left-clicking them)
- The Sell/Destroy frames will now retain their positions upon reloading the UI, and will be closed upon pressing the Escape key
