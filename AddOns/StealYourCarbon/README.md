StealYourCarbon is a simple reagent restocker addon.  When you visit a vendor
who sells an item you have told SYC to buy, it buys it for you.  Never run out
of water again!

SYC will also attempt to restock from your bank.  Note that this feature is
fairly simple, if you have multiple stacks of the item in your bank SYC will
only pull form the first one it finds.  If this stack is not enough to fill your
bag the next stack in the bank **will not be used** until you reopen the bank.
SYC will not try to split stacks either, so you'll always get a full stack in
your bags if enough items are available on the first stack in your bank.
